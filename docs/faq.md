### Can I get slashed if I go offline?

> No, inactivity is not considered a slashable offense. Refer to [Slashing on Ethereum PoS](background/slash.md).

### Is Puffer a non custodial Liquid Stake Pool?

> Yes, puffer is a non custodial (self custodial) liquid staking pool where users have control over pufETH in their own wallet.
> Users can choose what to do with their assets.

### How much are the fees on Puffer?

> Puffer charges only 2.5% staking rewards fees. This will be stored at Puffer Pool's DAO where the direction of the protocol is decided and treasury is managed.

### When Testnet?

> Q2 2023

### When Mainnet?

> Q3 2023

### How many slashes occured so far? Should we even care about slashable offenses?

> Last year, there was 220 slashed validators.

> This number might not seem much, however it is an existential threat to any staker on Ethereum 2.0. Imagine a consensu client used by validators is updated with a bug that causes mass slashing event. This would lead slashing of thousands of ETH.

> It is a low probability occurence with existential risk.

### How is the validator key and private key being managed in your system?

### Wasn't SGX hacked a billion times? Why would you use it?

### Can't just other permissionless pools reduce their bond requirement to 2ETH?

### There's this super cool technology called Distributed Validator Technology (DVT). Do we even need Secure-Signer when we have that?

> Today, DVT is great for ensuring uptime in a permissioned/centralized node operations; however, it would suffer from latency and efficiancy.

> DVT mitigates accidental slashable offenses but does not eliminate them like Secure-Signer does.

> In a permissionless setting, DVT has many unanswered questions including the lazy node operators and withdrawals. Are all cluster memebrs going to agree to withdraw the validator from beaconchain? How should the rewards be distributed in an efficiant way.

> NoOps are now required to spin up many instances to be considered profitable.

> You can think of Secure-Signer as a DVT technology but for permissionless operations.

### Is Puffer hiring?
