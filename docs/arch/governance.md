title: Governance

PUFI is the governance token for the Puffer DAO and is used to vote on the Puffer Pool ecosystemâ€™s
direction in the form of grants (e.g., for research, code optimizations, developer tools, etc) and for
voting on protocol updates to the LSD smart contract (e.g., updates to remote attestation contract,
fees, etc). The DAO is responsible for managing the treasury that accumulates protocol fees. Since
Puffer is permissionless, the DAO is not responsible for whitelisting or selecting NoOps which may
lead to cartelization.
