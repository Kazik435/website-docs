In the Puffer Pool, `Puffer Pods` consist of one NoOp and multiple Stakers. The NoOp must provide a 2 ETH bond and is then paired with Stakers, who contribute chunks of 30 ETH in increments of 0.01 ETH. The Pod registers a validator key, generated by the NoOpâ€™s Secure-Signer, and joins the validator queue. Stakers mint Puffer's [pufETH LSD](arch/pufeth.md) (one-to-one with their staked ETH), while the NoOp mints
locked pufETH for their bonded ETH.

The NoOp splits execution rewards based on the [Smoothing Factor](arch/smoothing.md). Some ETH is immediately rewarded to the proposing NoOp, while the rest is socialized across the Puffer Pool and Treasury. The consensus rewards are distributed to the pool with a small fee going to the Treasury to fuel protocol development. The ETH from consensus rewards will automatically accrue on a weekly basis following the [Shanghai/Capella](https://notes.ethereum.org/@launchpad/withdrawals-faq) update.

## Burst Threshold
As part of Puffer's commitment to building a decentralized Ethereum, we are self-limiting the size of the Puffer Pool. We refer to this as the `Burst Threshold` with a maximum capacity of 22%. This means that if the Puffer Pool reaches 22% of the validator set, pufETH minting and NoOp onboarding will freeze. 

This commitment is critical to ensure that the Puffer Pool never breaches the dangerous consensus threshold of 33%, which threatens the stability of Ethereum. We firmly believe that the Burst Threshold must be included from day one rather than after the pool is profitable.
