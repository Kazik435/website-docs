In the Puffer Pool, `Puffer Pods` consist of one NoOp and multiple Stakers. The NoOp must provide a 2 ETH bond and is then paired with Stakers, who contribute chunks of 30 ETH in increments of 0.01 ETH. The Pod registers a validator key, generated by the NoOpâ€™s Secure-Signer, and joins the validator queue. Stakers mint Puffer's [pufETH LSD](arch/pufeth.md) (one-to-one with their staked ETH), while the NoOp mints
locked pufETH for their bonded ETH. The NoOp's pufETH serves as collateral while allowing them to earn consensus rewards on their 2 ETH bond beyond the execution rewards. 

As NoOps earn consensus rewards, following the [Shanghai/Capella](https://notes.ethereum.org/@launchpad/withdrawals-faq) upgrade, ETH will be partially withdrawn to the pool every week. The Treasury receives a 2.5% fee to fuel protocol development, while the remaining 97.5% is distributed to the pool, increasing the value accrued by pufETH.

## Burst Threshold
As part of Puffer's commitment to building a decentralized Ethereum, we are self-limiting the size of the Puffer Pool. We refer to this as the `Burst Threshold` with a maximum capacity of 22%. This means that if the Puffer Pool reaches 22% of the validator set, pufETH minting and NoOp onboarding will freeze. 

This commitment is critical to ensure that the Puffer Pool never breaches the dangerous consensus threshold of 33%, which threatens the stability of Ethereum. We firmly believe that the Burst Threshold must be included from day one rather than after the pool is profitable.
