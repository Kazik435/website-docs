## Joining

To stake ETH on Puffer and receive pufETH (Pufffer's LSD), you simply need to connect your wallet and mint pufETH with as low as 0.01 ETH.

Your pufETH will accrue in value over time and it will increase in value per the Pool's APR.

You can also stake pufETH on other DeFi platforms to earn more yield.

Example:

- If you staked 1 ETH, you will receive 1 pufETH.

- With an APR of 10%, your ETH would increase and your wallet will show 1.1 pufETH after some time.

## Exiting

Simply connect your wallet on Puffer's website, burn pufETH, and claim ETH.
