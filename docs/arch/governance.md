title: Governance

PUFI is the governance token for the Puffer DAO and is used to vote on the Puffer Pool ecosystemâ€™s
direction in the form of grants (e.g., for research, code optimizations, developer tools, etc) and for
voting on protocol updates to the LSD smart contract (e.g., updates to remote attestation contract,
fees, etc). The DAO is responsible for managing the treasury that accumulates protocol fees.

Since Puffer is permissionless, the DAO is not responsible for whitelisting or selecting NoOps which may
lead to cartelization.

## How to Join

Simply purchase PUFI and you would have a vote in the Puffer Protocol's direction.

## Proposals

Proposals will be submitted through Puffer's Forum (coming soon!) and they are called Puffer's Improvement Plans or PIP for short.

## Voting

You can directly vote on a proposal. We know that it might be time-consuming to vote and review each proposal, so we enable vote delegation.
PUFI owners can delegate their voting power to some of the trusted and professional Puffer community delegates.
