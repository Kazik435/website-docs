Puffer’s liquid staking protocol uses a combination of cryptoeconomics and a novel slash-protection mechanism to solve the problem of lowering the NoOp bond requirement in a permissionless setting ([without waiting for 0x03 withdrawal credentials](https://ethresear.ch/t/withdrawal-credentials-exits-based-on-a-generalized-message-bus/12516)). We believe our solution is the most decentralized and trust-minimized solution to be built with Ethereum’s ethos in mind. We reduce the total bond requirement to just 2 ETH, which is split between the Secure-Router (SR, a module built from Secure-Signer) and NoOps (e.g., $1$ ETH for SR and $N * \frac{1}{N}$ ETH for NoOps). 

Puffer introduces Puffer DVT (pDVT), an optimized version of [DVT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awBX1SrXOhk&t=898s) that resolves the problems of using DVT in a permissionless setting. Each pDVT group contains $N$ NoOps, is led by an SR and manages a single validator key on behalf of the Puffer Pool. Each NoOp operates like a normal validator, signing block proposals and attestations with their validator key share, then forwards their signatures to the SR. The duty of the SR is to aggregate signatures from NoOps, provide an additional layer of slash protection via Secure-Signer, and sign Voluntary Exit messages (VEMs) if the NoOps go offline or misbehave.

The pDVT’s cryptoeconomics are designed to incentivize the SR or the NoOps to sign VEMs to withdraw if the opposite party misbehaves, protecting the pool’s staked ETH from inactivity penalties. For example, if the SR stops receiving responses from the NoOps, they are incentivized to sign and post a VEM to prevent harm to their deposit. Similarly, if an SR goes offline or decides to censor, the NoOps can sign and aggregate VEMs on-chain to exit and protect their bonds. 

Beyond solving the core problem of inactivity penalties, pDVTs enable previously impossible [MEV-Smoothing](arch/mev.md), which increases the Puffer Pool’s competitiveness. Execution rewards (priority fees + MEV) constitute the largest part of a NoOp’s revenue. Centralized pools can arbitrarily share execution rewards with the pool to increase APR and capture more market share. To remain competitive, permissionless pools should be able to offer similar yields to their LSD holders.

In the Puffer Pool, `Puffer Pods` consist of a pDVT group and multiple Stakers. The pDVT group must provide a 2 ETH bond and is then paired with Stakers, who contribute chunks of 30 ETH in increments of $\ge 0.01$ ETH. 

The Pod registers a validator key (generated by SR’s Secure-Signer instance) and joins the validator queue. Stakers mint Puffer's [pufETH LSD](arch/pufeth.md) (one-to-one with their staked ETH), while the pDVT group mints locked pufETH for their bonded ETH. The pDVT group's pufETH serves as collateral while allowing them to earn consensus rewards on their 2 ETH bond beyond the execution rewards. 

As the pDVT group earns consensus rewards, following the [Shanghai/Capella](https://notes.ethereum.org/@launchpad/withdrawals-faq) upgrade, ETH will be partially withdrawn to the pool on a weekly basis. The Treasury receives a 2.5% fee from consensus rewards while the remaining 97.5% is distributed to the pool, increasing the value accrued by pufETH. Additionally, 2.5% of execution rewards are received by the Treasury, and the remaining is split between the pDVT group and the pool according to the **Smoothing Factor**.

# Burst Threshold
As part of Puffer's commitment to building a decentralized Ethereum, we are self-limiting the size of the Puffer Pool. We refer to this as the `Burst Threshold` with a maximum capacity of 22%. This means that if the Puffer Pool reaches 22% of the validator set, pufETH minting and pDVT group onboarding will freeze. 

This commitment is critical to ensure that the Puffer Pool never breaches the dangerous consensus threshold of 33%, which threatens the stability of Ethereum. We firmly believe that the Burst Threshold must be included from day one rather than after the pool is profitable.
