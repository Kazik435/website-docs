To register as a Node Operator (NoOp) and spin up a validator instance at Puffer Pool you would follow these steps:

## Joining

- NoOp running Secure-Signer saves a fresh validator key to its encrypted and persistent enclave
  memory. (Intel SGX for now)

- NoOp performs Remote Attestation committing to a validator key.

- NoOp submits attestation evidence (with RAVE, another product of Puffer, stay tuned) and 2 ETH to permissionless NoOp onboarding contract.

- Onboarding contract verifies the key was generated by Secure-Signer, pairs the NoOp with 30
  Staker ETH, and registers the Puffer Pod in the beacon deposit contract.

- pufETH is minted for the 2 ETH NoOp bond but is locked.

- The NoOp performs validator duties on behalf of the Pod, earning consensus and execution
  rewards.

- Secure-Signer prevents the NoOp from accidentally signing slashable material.

## Exiting

- NoOp would submit their voluntary exit message to the pool.

- NoOp will receive their bond in ETH.
